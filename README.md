Real Time Bus Tracking System
 Real-Time Bus Tracking System is an innovative software solution designed to enhance the efficiency and convenience of public transportation. This system integrates advanced technologies, including GPS and Google Maps, to provide users with real-time information about bus locations, routes, and nearby bus stops.
 
Real-Time Location Tracking

The core functionality of the Real-Time Bus Tracking System is its ability to track buses in real-time using GPS technology. Each bus in the fleet is equipped with a GPS device that continuously transmits its location data to a central server. This data is then processed and displayed on the application, allowing users to see the exact location of buses on a map.(GPS is being created by Hardware Team i was handling software part)

IP Address Integration

To enhance user convenience, the system utilizes the user's IP address to determine their current location. By identifying the userâ€™s location, the system can quickly provide relevant information about nearby bus stops without requiring manual input of the location. This feature simplifies the user experience and ensures that the information provided is accurate and timely.

Google Maps Integration

The integration with Google Maps is a critical component of the system. Google Maps provides a reliable and familiar interface for users to view bus locations, routes, and stops. One can view bus routes and stops in the map.

Comprehensive Bus Route Information

The system provides detailed information about each bus route, including the entire list of stops, the sequence of stops. Users can view the full route of any bus, helping them understand the complete journey and make informed decisions about their travel plans.
